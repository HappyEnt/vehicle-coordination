Vehicle Coordination Introduction
=================================

This project is a template on how to structure your project for the final submission.
Your project repository should serve as the main entry point, therefore also explaining the fundamental motivation and goals.
We expect all components of the project to be included in this single repository.
While this might not match your workflow (e.g. you use multiple git repositories), it should allow for an easier administration and setup later.  
Keep in mind that you do not need to work in this repository and that you can easily copy commits from other repositories (see [components](components/index.md) how to copy).
